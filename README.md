Micro JS project starter, kinda like part of my dotfiles...start writing JS
with unit tests, linting, and ES6 in like 20 seconds.

`git clone https://github.com/stuartsan/js-starter $WHATEVER`  
`cd $WHATEVER`

Optionally wipe out this starter project's history and initialize a new repo:

`rm -rf .git/`  
`git init`  
`echo node_modules/ >> .gitignore`

Then grab stuff:

`npm install`

And do stuff:

`npm test` OR  
`npm run test-watch` OR  
`npm run lint`
